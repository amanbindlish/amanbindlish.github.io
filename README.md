  Aman Bindlish - Portfolio App
</h1>

Experimented with React to learn and make single web app, so built my own basic portfolio. Also managed to work the portfolio on all screen sizes.
I'll be adding more features into the same very soon. You can also have a look on the final portfolio [here](https://amanbindlish.github.io).
